==================

This is a basic kind of breakout game made in order to teach [cocos2d for iPhone][1].

This is not a full game and its purpose is purely educational.

This project was built from a cocos2d for iPhone v2.0 template and were added the following features:

  * Fixed iOS 6 orientation
  * Portrait orientation
  * Touches events control
  * Simple collision detection
  * Basic game loop

This project was developed by [Alberto Gonzalez][3] for a cocos2d workshop at [Barcelona Developers Conference][4] 2012.

Please, fell free to use and distribute this project as much as you want but remember to mention the author.

The version of [cocos2d for iPhone][1] used in this project was v2.0. You can download the [cocos2d for iPhone][1] from [cocos2d-iphone.org/download][2].

You'll need a Mac with Xcode 4 in order to build & run this project.
